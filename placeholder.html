            There's good news and there's bad news. The good news is that
            <a href="https://www.comic-con.org/cci" target="_blank">Comic-Con</a>
            is in San Diego the same weekend as our wedding, so there will be tons
            to do downtown complete with fun events and silly costumes. The bad
            news is that the 130,000 people attending Comic-Con will also need
            hotel rooms. Fortunately, we have a few suggestions within walking
            distance of the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WbVbEREQQ2J2" target="_blank">venue</a>:
